    r "If, you would stop doing this pathetic excuse of an attempt at flirting and frankly creepy shit you're doing, that is."

    "God, this guy. Now he looked confused at me."
    weeb think "Uhm, what are you talking about?"

    r "You!"
    r "I never imagined even once that I would have this conversation with you!"

    r "But apparently it's needed for you to face fucking facts. You're disgusting, you know?"

    weeb "Aha, don't say it like tha-"

    r "I am fucking serious!"
    r "All you do is jump from one girl to the next like a perverted dog in heat!"
    r "I think I've slapped you and pepper sprayed you at least 50 times now and you still don't get it!"
    r "Girls don't like it when you're trying your mating rituals! Why don't you get it?!"

    weeb "..."

    weeb "I would not per se say that I made any moves on any of the ladies downstairs though."

    r "That's totally besides the point!"

    weeb "...Kind of?"
    weeb "You are not mad at me then?"

    r "But... Look. You're helping me by spending your time. I can't pay you back in money, but what if I gave you some actual tips on how to get into a girl's pants?"

    r "Not only would it help you, but also all the girls who have to listen to your constant barking."

    weeb "You'd do that?"

    r "I am the master matchmaker in this school for a reason after all."

    sandra "Oh? And what would that be?"

    r "It's not something I'm planning on telling you."

    sandra "Ah darn. For a moment I thought it was because you gave him your console."

    sandra "I didn't think I'd see the day where you of all people would give it away for free."

    r "He just... Asked for it."
    "He did. But it wasn't specifically him who wanted that video game thing."
    "Apparently David had nothing to do all day, so rather than him doing weird shit in my body, I'd let him play on that thing instead. He did ask Rick to bring it to him now that he was here anyways."

    "I did make it perfectly clear that absolutely {i}nobody{/i}, especially my parents, should ever find out about it."
    "And it wasn't like I'd ever use it myself, so while we were swapped, he could have that piece of junk."
    mcmom "I know I've asked this at least ten times this week but are you sure you're alright David?"

    r "Wha- No no, none of that. I just... felt like it..."

    r "A movie?"

    r "What kind of movie?"

    mcmom "Anything you'd like."
    think "Huh... Well, if David gets to act however he wants in front of the people I know, I'm sure I should be allowed to watch some crappy teen movie."

    r "I'd love to. And if there is still some of your fruit salad left, we totally should have some while watching. That stuff was just delish."
