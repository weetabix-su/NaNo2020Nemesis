    #Lunch BG, with every popular girls

    mc "Here."
    #MC go to PG
    "I handed her one of the sandwiches I bought for lunch."

    pg "...Thanks..."

    pg "So you were serious about last day..."

    mc "I usually forced you to do things for me, right?"

    pg "You didn't force me! I just did it because you're you."

    "Who would have thought that showing kindness to someone would make them feel awkward."

    "PG was really insistent on not having been used by Rumi, which is probably worse than knowingly being used."
    "Being a bit more level-headed now and not acting on the spur of the moment that unfolded two days ago, I realized that being nice to pg probably wasn't going to result in payback towards Rumi for what she did at all."
    "I doubted that she'd even care to be honest."
    "But I might as well try to establish a friendly relationship with her if things aren't changing anytime soon."
    "She is a nice girl anyways, at least when she isn't being an asshole with Rumi nearby."

    rfriend "I never thought I would see the day where you of all people do literally any work for someone. It is really refreshing to see."

    pg "It is Rumi, after all!"

    rfriend "Yeah, yeah, we get it."
    rfriend "Changing topic, have you heard the rumor?"

    pg "About Sandra?"

    #Curious MC

    rfriend "You believe it?"

    mc "Wait, what rumor?"

    rfriend "You don't know one of the big rumors going around? They are saying that Sandra suddenly decided to transfer schools."

    pg "One way or another, not having to deal with that snake is something I am glad about."
    think "What? Why would Sandra transfer to another school?"

    mc "It's the Sandra that is in the Student Council?"

    rfriend "That's the one. She is in our homeroom, or was supposed to be."

    rfriend "But she hasn't showed up at all and apparently cut off all contact with everyone."

    mc "That's... Odd..."

    pg "Who knows what goes on in her head."

    think "There is no other high school in town and as far as I know, she doesn't have a boyfriend either..."
    think "Agh, who cares, it's just a rumor, and I have my own problems right now."

    mc "Anyways, I have to go talk to someone, so I'll be leaving."

    pg "Don't tell me you're going to be talking with MC again."

    mc "No, I'm not. And why do you care about me talking with him?"

    rfriend "You've been talking with that twerp?"

    pg "She's been talking with him way too much lately!"

    pg "I told her to tell us if she needs help dealing with him but she insists she doesn't need help."

    mc "Because I don't, so get off my back already."

    rfriend "5 bucks she wants to make a move on Mike now that she's trying to reform herself like she's a fairy godmother."

    pg "{i}Sigh...{/i}"

    pg "Rumi, for real, if-"

    mc "If you're trying to tell me that I should ask you or someone for help again, then help me god, I'm taking that fucking sandwich with me."

    pg "What?! I haven't even eaten half of it yet!"

    mc "Exactly."

    pg "Ugh, you better not end up in a bad situation."

    mc "Hey, I got things under control."

    pg "Fine..."

    "Who would have thought that she was this protective of Rumi."
    think "I wonder if the love is mutual the other way around?"

    think "Nah, who am I kidding, Rumi would leave that girl on the pavement in the rain if she could."

    "PG didn't even get angry at me for skipping out on the cheerleading I was supposedly the captain of now either."
    "It did, however, make her worry at least twice as much about whether something was going on with Rumi's life behind the scenes."
    "Which in turn kind of makes her more of a pain to deal with. But at least it's well-meant pain."

    "Anyhow, my goal was to try and approach someone I knew would consider this swap a possible thing that could happen."
    "There is a solution for every problem, however. And my solution in this case would be Mike."

    think "Man, I'm sounding like a real detective hatching a plan or something."

    "He was sitting together with a few guys I couldn't recognize and Eric."

    "But considering how I currently looked, approaching him and getting to talk with him likely wouldn't be an issue."
    think "Well, time to put on my gameface."
    mc "Hey guys."

    "Some had already seen me approaching, but none probably thought I wanted to talk to them."

    "They greeted me, almost in unison. Quite the pretty pack of popular guys were here."
    mike "What's up."
    eric "Hey."
    mc "Mike, can I talk to you alone for a minute?"
    mike "Me?"
    mc "Yeah, you."
    "They murmured quietly about how I was going to confess to him or some crap, but Brad himself looked a bit more surprised than anything."
    mike "Uh, sure, why not."
    eric "Bah, you shouldn't. You know her."
    brad "It's alright. Be right back guys."
    "He followed me out of the lunch area where we talked mostly in private."

    mc "I'll make it quick. I need you to do me a favor."
    mike "Name it."
    mc "Can you bring me Weeb?"

    "Once more he had a surprised look on his face, which quickly turned to a more annoyed one."
    mike "I could, and probably would..."
    mike "But does this have anything to do with your attitude towards that girl?"
    mc "Uh?"
    mike "We all know your relationship with that group."
    mc "Mike, I'm not trying to be mean-spirited at all, I know I've been an absolute bitch towards her, but I genuinely need to talk to her, and ideally Weeb too."
    mike "Hmm..."
    "He thought it through for a good minute. I couldn't really blame him either, no way he wanted to get caught up in this mess."
    mike "Alright. But if you're lying, you know what happens. Be right back."
    mc "Oh, and don't tell them I sent you. And, uh, make sure nobody follow them."
    mike "Got it."

    "He wandered off..."
    #Weeb comes here
    "And sure enough, he appeared a minute later."
    "When they realized that it was me who had sent Brad, it startled them both a bit."
    mc "Hey. Can we talk for a sec?"

    weeb "I cannot believe it. Could it be that you finally realize my love towa-"
    mc "Okay, stuff it. I just want to talk with you."
    "One after another, I got surprised looks from them. This must be so unlike Rumi to them."
    mc "Sorry to pull you out from mealtime."

    weeb "Anything for you."

    weeb "It would be my honor to accept your confession after a long fought battle for your heart."

    think "Kiiinda beginning to see why people get the urge to slap him."

    mc "At least you're dependant."

    mc "Even though it's because of the way I look..."

    weeb "Dearest, you appear to be going red. Is it a fever? Should I carry you to the nurse's office?"

    mc "Oh, no no, please, I'm fine. I'm just... Angry."
    mc "Thanks for telling me. You still believe in sci-fi and aliens and all that crap, right?"

    weeb "Oh? Could it be that it is a secret passion of yourself too?!"

    mc "So you believe in that stuff, right?"

    weeb "Of course not! I do not believe, I know!"

    mc "Uh... Yeah, that's fine too."

    mc "So would you believe me if I said that I was actually MC?"

    weeb "...MC? What do you mean?"

    mc "I am MC, and the MC you talked to yesterday was Rumi. Me and Rumi have had our bodies swapped."

    "It took him awhile to process that information, but for some reason he eventually got around to the idea."

    weeb "MC, is that you?!"

    mc "Yeah, it's me."
    weeb "By all that is alien, I cannot believe you managed to find a high tech alien device that would let you freely alter anyone as you desire!"
    mc "...That's... No, I don't have a thing like that."

    mc "Also, why the hell do you believe me so quickly?!"
    mc "I had like at least ten different facts ready to tell you to prove to you I'm the real deal!"

    weeb "My friends obviously would not try to deceive me."

    think "That's... not how it works."

    weeb "Hey, so that means you get to see the lovely Rumi naked?"

    mc "Uhm, well, yeah... But-"

    weeb "Score for you, man!"
    weeb "You really picked the delicate target for your shenanigans! Please tell me how to do it!"
    mc "It's not something I did! I just woke up as her four days ago without any warning."
    weeb "So a mystery swap... Maybe we could research this to be able to replicate it."

    mc "Oh, yeah we could. I want to go back as soon as possible."

    weeb "Go back? Are you a madman? This is the golden opportunity to claim the rank of number one beauty!"

    mc "Living as her is a nightmare."
    weeb "...So I can have dibs on her?"
    mc "For all I care, sure, as long as I get back to being myself."

    weeb "It is settled then! The plan is in motion!"

    mc "What plan?"
    weeb "The plan to get me a smoking hot girlfriend, J-man!"

    mc "No that's not the plan at all."

    weeb "We weren't talking about getting me a smoking hot girlfriend?"

    mc "We were talking about having me become myself again."

    weeb "Ah! I must have gotten carried away."
    mc "...Right."

    mc "And can you please try to convince the girls to believe me too? Rumi must have tried to keep me from telling you guys, but probably didn't anticipate your... Uh... Personality."

    weeb "Of course. When have I ever let you down?"
    think "Yeah I don't want to answer that."
    mc "Thank god someone believes me. See you later man, I should get back before pg starts having another panic attack."
    weeb "I wish you all the best on your explorations!"

    "It felt like something had been lifted off my chest. Knowing someone else knew who I really was would be a big help."

    "Knowing that Weeb wouldn't try to hit on me was really just the icing on the cake."
    "At least I hoped he wouldn't."
    "Like, really hoped."

    #go back to lunch

    "But... Uh, PG is apparently already having her breakdown."

    pg "-she's being blackmailed, oh god she's being blackmai-"

    rfriend "Fucking really, Rumi?"
    rfriend "Him of all people?"
    pg "-oh god she's being blackmailed, oh god she's being blackmailed, oh go-"
    rfriend "pg has been like this for three freaking minutes now!"
    mc "Wha-?"

    pg "Fuck! Saya! What are you doing?! What are they doing to you?!"

    mc "...I... Was in the bathroom...?"
    pg "You absolutely terrible liar! We all saw you taking those two space-nerds with you and returning with- Ew! Weeb!"

    mc "I was just talking with him, why is that a big deal?"

    rfriend "Are you seriously asking why it's not a big deal to be seen talking privately with the prime predator of the school?"

    rfriend "Do you actually have the hots for him?"

    pg "Please say no, please say no, please say no-"

    mc "Why the hell would I be into him? If anything then Eric or Mi-"

    mc "Wait, fuck no!"

    think "Why did I just think of Eric or Mike as boyfriends?!"
    think "Am I suddenly gay or something?!"

    rfriend "In every other scenario, yes. But this is Weeb. I wouldn't wish that for her, even despite... You know."

    pg "I am {i}not{/i} leaving you out of sight anymore! From now on, it's back to you being normal Saya! I can't stand this!"

    mc "...So I can't be nice to you?"

    pg "...Yes, you can! But..."

    think "At this point she is probably struggling to find an excuse to both be treated nice and things going back to how they were before I became Rumi."

    mc "{size=-5}Heh...{/size}"

    pg "What are you laughing at? This is serious!"

    mc "Oh, nothing... Just nothing..."

label Day3_Rumi:
    #scene bg library

    "I was currently reading all of the books I could find in the school library that had even a slight similarity on people suddenly changing personalities, but fuck."
    "There were like three, and all of them absolutely boring. Turned out none of them were similar to my swap."

    think "At least I've ended up not having to sit with the circle of losers today."

    think "That would only have made this day even worse."

    "The library was a place where I went to, like, once in my life. Some people even forget that this thing exists."
    "Only time I've been here was when Ms. Clark forced us to do some throwaway projects and presentations here."
    "But ultimately, even if it was a very small glimmer of hope, this was a real waste of time."

    think "Who would have thought that I, Rumi Sato, would be staying late at school voluntarily..."


    think "...I could really go for some shopping right now..."

    "I just laid with my face down on the desk for a minute or two until two girls came crashing into the library with their conversation."

    popgirl "-you sure? I thought that thing was her thing."

    rfriend "Gah, just fuck off already and let me have my peace for a bit..."

    popgirl "It totally was! I reckon something must'a changed."
    rfriend "Did you try talking to her about it? I'm sure she would freak out like crazy if we just gave the position to you without asking her..."
    think "Wait, I know those voices."
    think "I know them from cheerlea-"
    think "..."
    think "Cheerleading!"
    think "Fuck! I forgot all about that! And that dumbhead probably didn't go to it!"

    popgirl "Of course not. Do y'all think I have the guts to ask 'er something like that? What if she jus' forgot going and goes all ape on me? I'd be roast."

    rfriend "Hah, you're gonna be in so much trouble if Rumi simply forgot about it."
    think "If I forgot?"

    "It clicked. The selection of the cheerleading captain was each half year, and if I wasn't there yesterday for the first round of training..."

    "This was the last straw for today. I fumingly, while still trying to keep my temper, walked over to them to make sure."
    r "Hey girls. Who did you say was the cheerleader captain now?"
    rfriend "Huh? Who are you?"

    popgirl "Ooh! I've seen 'em before! They always hanging out with that Weeb fella'!"

    rfriend "Ew, that guy."
    r "Just tell me."

    rfriend "Chill. It's been Rumi for two years now, but we elected Sadie-Lynn here yesterday."
    rfriend "You into cheerleader captains?"
    r "Fuck off. Not in the mood."

    rfriend "Wha-"

    think "MC keeps humiliating me, huh?"

    rfriend "Did you tell him about me?"

    popgirl "Honest to god, never heard 'em talk before."

    think "Hah, you think I'll just sit here and do nothing?"

    #hide the girls

    think "..."

    "I was about to leave the library before I stopped to think about this."
    "He deserved it for doing something terrible to my life, right?"
    "Like hell I would let that bitch Sadie have my spot as the captain for the most prestigious group in this school."
    "This was his fault!"
    "But for some reason this felt like a rabbit hole that would only go deeper."

    think "..."

    r "Nah, fuck it, he deserves it."
