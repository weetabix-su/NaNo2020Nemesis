    "I handed her one of the sandwiches I bought for lunch."

    pg "...Thanks..."

    pg "So you were serious about last day..."

    mc "I usually forced you to do things for me, right?"

    pg "You didn't force me! I just did it because you're you."

    "Who would have thought that showing kindness to someone would make them feel awkward."

    "Angela was really insistent on not having been used by Rumi, which is probably worse than knowingly being used."
    "Being a bit more level-headed now and not acting on the spur of the moment that unfolded two days ago, I realized that being nice to Angela probably wasn't going to result in payback towards Rumi for what she did at all."
    "I doubted that she'd even care to be honest."
    "But I might as well try to establish a friendly relationship with her if things aren't changing anytime soon."
    "She is a nice girl anyways, at least when she isn't being an asshole with Rumi nearby."

    rfriend "I never thought I would see the day where you of all people do literally any work for someone. It is really refreshing to see."

    pg "It is Rumi, after all!"

    rfriend "Yeah, yeah, we get it."
    rfriend "Changing topic, have you heard the rumor?"

    pg "About Sandra?"

    #Curious MC

    rfriend "You believe it?"

    mc "Wait, what rumor?"

    rfriend "You don't know one of the big rumors going around? They are saying that Sandra suddenly decided to transfer schools."

    pg "One way or another, not having to deal with that snake is something I am glad about."
    think "What? Why would Sandra transfer to another school?"

    mc "It's the Sandra that is in the Student Council?"

    rfriend "That's the one. She is in our homeroom, or was supposed to be."

    rfriend "But she hasn't showed up at all and apparently cut off all contact with everyone."

    mc "That's... Odd..."

    pg "Who knows what goes on in her head."

    think "There is no other high school in town and as far as I know, she doesn't have a boyfriend either..."
    think "Agh, who cares, it's just a rumor, and I have my own problems right now."

    mc "Anyways, I have to go talk to someone, so I'll be leaving."

    pg "Don't tell me you're going to be talking with David again."

    mc "No, I'm not. And why do you care about me talking with him?"

    rfriend "You've been talking with that twerp?"

    pg "She's been talking with him way too much lately!"

    pg "I told her to tell us if she needs help dealing with him but she insists she doesn't need help."

    mc "Because I don't, so get off my back already."

    rfriend "5 bucks she wants to make a move on Mike now that she's trying to reform herself like she's a fairy godmother."

    pg "{i}Sigh...{/i}"

    pg "Rumi, for real, if-"

    mc "If you're trying to tell me that I should ask you or someone for help again, then help me god, I'm taking that fucking sandwich with me."

    pg "What?! I haven't even eaten half of it yet!"

    mc "Exactly."

    pg "Ugh, you better not end up in a bad situation."

    mc "Hey, I got things under control."

    "Who would have thought that she was this protective of Rumi."
    think "I wonder if the love is mutual the other way around?"

    think "Nah, who am I kidding, Rumi would leave that girl on the pavement in the rain if she could."

    "Angela didn't even get angry at me for skipping out on the cheerleading I was supposedly the captain of now either."
    "It did, however, make her worry at least twice as much about whether something was going on with Rumi's life behind the scenes."
    "Which in turn kind of makes her more of a pain to deal with. But at least it's well-meant pain."

    "Anyhow, my goal was to try and approach someone I knew would consider this swap a possible thing that could happen."
    "There is a solution for every problem, however. And my solution in this case would be Mike."

    think "Man, I'm sounding like a real detective hatching a plan or something."

    "He was sitting together with a few guys I couldn't recognize and Eric."

    "But considering how I currently looked, approaching him and getting to talk with him likely wouldn't be an issue."
    think "Well, time to put on my gameface."
    mc "Hey guys."

    "Some had already seen me approaching, but none probably thought I wanted to talk to them."

    "They greeted me, almost in unison. Quite the pretty pack of popular guys were here."
    mike "What's up."
    eric "Hey."
    mc "Mike, can I talk to you alone for a minute?"
    mike "Me?"
    mc "Yeah, you."
    "They murmured quietly about how I was going to confess to him or some crap, but Mike himself looked a bit more surprised than anything."
    mike "Uh, sure, why not."
    eric "Bah, you shouldn't. You know her."
    mike "It's alright. Be right back guys."
    "He followed me out of the lunch area where we talked mostly in private."

    mc "I'll make it quick. I need you to do me a favor."
    mike "Name it."
    mc "Can you bring me Rick?"

    "Once more he had a surprised look on his face, which quickly turned to a more annoyed one."
    mike "I could, and probably would..."
    mike "But does this have anything to do with your attitude towards that girl?"
    mc "Uh?"
    mike "We all know your relationship with that group."
    mc "Mike, I'm not trying to be mean-spirited at all, I know I've been an absolute bitch towards her, but I genuinely need to talk to her, and ideally Rick too."
    mike "Hmm..."
    "He thought it through for a good minute. I couldn't really blame him either, no way he wanted to get caught up in this mess."
    mike "Alright. But if you're lying, you know what happens. Be right back."
    mc "Oh, and don't tell them I sent you. And, uh, make sure nobody follow them."
    mike "Got it."

    "He wandered off..."
    #Weeb comes here
    "And sure enough, he appeared a minute later."
    "When they realized that it was me who had sent Mike, it startled them both a bit."

    weeb laugh "I cannot believe it. Could it be that you finally realize my love towa-"
    mc "Okay, stuff it. I just want to talk with you."
    "One after another, I got surprised looks from them. This must be so unlike Rumi to them."

    show weeb happy

    mc "Oh, no no, please, I'm fine. I'm just... Angry."
    mc "Thanks for telling me. You still believe in sci-fi and aliens and all that crap, right?"

    weeb laugh "Oh? Could it be that it is a secret passion of yourself too?!"
    show weeb happy

    mc "So you believe in that stuff, right?"

    weeb laugh "Of course not! I do not believe, I know!"
    show weeb happy

    mc "Uh... Yeah, that's fine too."

    mc "So would you believe me if I said that I was actually David?"

    weeb think "...David? What do you mean?"

    mc "I am David, and the David you talked to yesterday was Rumi. Me and Rumi have had our bodies swapped."

    "It took him awhile to process that information, but for some reason he eventually got around to the idea."

    weeb "David, is that you?!"

    mc "Yeah, it's me."
    weeb laugh "By all that is alien, I cannot believe you managed to find a high tech alien device that would let you freely alter anyone as you desire!"

    mc "...That's... No, I don't have a thing like that."

    mc "Also, why the hell do you believe me so quickly?!"

    weeb laugh "My friends obviously would not try to deceive me."

    mc "It's not something I did! I just woke up as her four days ago without any warning."
    weeb laugh "So a mystery swap... Maybe we could research this to be able to replicate it."
    show weeb happy

    mc "Oh, yeah we could. I want to go back as soon as possible."

    weeb laugh "Go back? Are you a madman? This is the golden opportunity to claim the rank of number one beauty!"

    weeb laugh "The plan to get me a smoking hot girlfriend, J-man!"

    mc "No that's not the plan at all."

    weeb laugh "We weren't talking about getting me a smoking hot girlfriend?"

    weeb laugh "Ah! I must have gotten carried away."
    show weeb happy

    mc "...Right."

    mc "And can you please try to convince the girls to believe me too? Rumi must have tried to keep me from telling you guys, but probably didn't anticipate your... Uh... Personality."

    weeb laugh "Of course. When have I ever let you down?"
    show weeb happy
    think "Yeah I don't want to answer that."

    think "At least I've ended up not having to sit with the circle of losers today."

    think "That would only have made this day even worse."

    "The library was a place where I went to, like, once in my life. Some people even forget that this thing exists."

    rfriend "Hah, you're gonna be in so much trouble if Rumi simply forgot about it."
    think "If I forgot?"

    "It clicked. The selection of the cheerleading captain was each half year, and if I wasn't there yesterday for the first round of training..."
