    mc "Huh? What's a truck doing here?!"

    pg "They are here with the alcohol and snacks, idiot."

    mc "Just how much do you think we're gonna be drinking?!"

    pg "{i}Sigh...{/i} Just don't think too much about it."

    mc "Alright then..."

    pg "Either way, we need to start getting you ready. Rumi doesn't want to fix you up, so I am going to have to do that."

    "Ah yeah, Rumi was perfectly able to do my hair and make-up and whatever else sort of ritual she performed before that mixer thing, but she refused to even talk to me right now."
    "Not that I was complaining. A bit of peace and quiet was always nice. At least when that peace and quiet was away from her."

    pg "Really, I can't believe you two are still fighting..."

    mc "It's not my fault she keeps attacking me for not living her life the way she wants."
    pg "Yeah, yeah, we get it, it's difficult having to get up in the morning to do your hair properly."

    pg "Now get your ass inside instead of staring at a couple delivery workers."

    "At least she knew what she was doing."

    "PG was using all kinds of potentially dangerous chemicals on my face, just like Rumi did."

    think "Although I probably wouldn't know the difference between what PG is doing right now and what Rumi did..."

    "I was fresh out of a nice shower and it was kind of refreshing to just sit around and have my face being operated on."

    mc "Hey."

    pg "What?"
    mc "You use this stuff often, right?"

    pg "Is that a serious question?"

    mc "Uh... Yeah."

    pg "Of course I do. There aren't many girls who don't use some sort of make-up."

    mc "Oh."

    mc "Right."
    mc "..."

    mc "Hey."

    pg "What?"

    mc "If I'm stuck like this for longer, can you teach me this stuff?"

    pg "You haven't looked up anything yourself?"

    mc "Uh... No."

    pg "Geez, you really aren't doing a lot to adapt yourself to being a girl, are you?"

    pg "But yeah, I can teach you."

    pg "Not right now since I need to do my own hair and face too, though. I haven't even showered myself yet."

    mc "Mhm."

    "I spent another good 10 to 15 minutes shackled to this impromptu saloon chair we put into the bathroom."

    "It honestly almost felt like pg had a better grip of what to do compared to Rumi."

    "In the very least, she was done faster."
    pg "Okay, done."

    pg "And don't touch your face for the next hour or so, or else you're going to end up looking like a ghost or some shit."

    mc "'Kay."

    pg "Now get out, I need to get ready too."
    pg "Shoo."

    pg "Find some clothes that don't suck while I'm doing my own appearance."

    mc "Will do."

    #Rumi's bedroom scene

    think "Okay, so I have to find clothes that \"don't suck\"."
    think "My wardrobe is absolutely massive, so it shouldn't be impossible to find something like that."
    think "..."

    think "Wait, what does \"don't suck\" even mean?"

    "Puzzled at how I should know exactly what \"doesn't suck\", I wavered my options."

    "And I wavered my options for about 15 seconds before just settling on the thing Rumi told me to wear during the mixer."

    think "Surely this falls under the category of \"doesn't suck\"."

    $ screenfilter.blur = 0

    "I got changed into this outfit once more and then turned on my EksBox."
    "Apparently, the people who were setting stuff up down below knew what they were doing, so there wasn't much for me to do anymore."
    "It was probably some party delivery thing, and I bet they've been here a couple times now."

    "While playing the same old games, I checked if any new games were cropping up. I had done nothing but play the same stuff for who knows how long now, and it was starting to get rather boring not having anything new."

    "And with Rumi's credit currently in my possession, surely she wouldn't get even angrier if I spent just a little on a new title or two to pass the time."

    "So there I was, browsing the shop, as I rarely do."

    think "Hm... Looks crappy... Looks like pay to win... Looks like some crappy fan-made japanese visual novel..."

    "Then I got my eyes on an apparently big reveal."
    think "Phantom Illusion... Huh, that looks cool."

    think "...Releases in a week.... Great..."

    "With nothing but disappointing looking titles apart from a few cool ones, I went back to trying to 100% this stupid game I played with pg."

    "Not long after, PG knocked on the door."
    pg "{size=-5}MC? Are my clothes in there?{/size}"

    think "Her clothes...?"

    "I looked around and remembered that she did drop her backpack of party clothes or whatever you call them off in here before we went to the bathroom together."

    mc "Yeah, they're here."

    pg "..."

    pg "{size=-5}Well, are you going to give them to me?{/size}"

    mc "The door is unlocked, just come in here."

    mc "...So what? You're going to be half naked out there for a long time if you're going to refuse coming in here."
    pg "{size=-5}MC!{/size}"

    mc "{i}Sigh...{/i}"

    mc "We told you about the entire sexuality thing that happened to us already, so chill, I'm not going to suddenly jump you or anything."

    mc "The game is probably more interesting anyways."

    pg "{size=-5}Urgh, fine!{/size}"

    #play sound sfx_door_open

    "With just a tad bit of hesitation, she finally came into the room."

    "Sure enough, she was wearing nothing but a towel. If I was still an actual guy I might have felt a bit differently, but the game I was playing was more interesting after all and required concentration, so I barely even bothered to look."

    mc "Hey-"

    pg "D- Don't you dare turn around!"

    mc "...I was just going to ask how you managed to beat this guy last time."

    pg "\"This guy\"? Oh, the Dedris King."

    pg "Wait, just, let me get changed first."

    mc "No need to hurry."

    scene black

    "In the end, we managed to spend some 10 or 15 minutes again playing before we went downstairs to check up on how things were going."
    "I was forced to wear my eye contacts, even though I was promised I could dress however I wanted to."
    "Guess I really didn't get anything out of that mixer thing after all..."

    pg "Hey, wait, we need the pult over in that corner!"

    think "And off she goes..."

    #marty = guy who install stuff for the party but I though giving him a name would be better
    marty "Ah, Ms. Sato, there you are."

    mc "Oh, uh... Yeah, that's me. What's up?"

    marty "We are about done with the set-up. Could you make sure everything is as it should be? Just say the word and we'll make sure to rectify any mistakes."

    mc "Yeah, yeah, of course."

    marty "Thanks."

    think "As if I know where everything is supposed to be, though."

    think "I better let PG handle this one..."

    marty "Once more, thank you for choosing our service."

    marty "I hope the party will turn out a success as always."

    think "Man, this guy is probably only a couple years older than me and is already talking as if he's from the middle-ages."

    think "Although it is kind of sweet how he addresses me-"

    think "No no no, bad thoughts!"

    mc "Thank you for your help. Have a safe trip back."

    marty "Thanks. And please give my regards to your father."

    mc "Heh... Uh, yeah, will do."

    "He got into the truck where the two other people that helped were already sitting."

    pg "At least there is some hope for the party now."

    mc "Hope? Uh... Am I supposed to know why?"

    pg "Considering you didn't embarrass yourself at all in front of the delivery guys."

    mc "Oh, like that."

    mc "If all I have to do is just walk around for an evening then it's going to be a piece of cake."

    pg "Well, you have to do a bit more than just \"walk around\", but it's a start."

    #show Rumi coming in

    "About thirty minutes after the delivery boys left, Rumi finally decided to show up."

    "Compared to what I've been put through, she sure didn't put in a lot of effort to make me look refined or whatever word she would use for herself."
    "It was just my usual clothes."

    pg "Rumi, there you are! How's it going?"

    r "Fine."

    pg "Oh... Uh, great."

    pg "There is still an hour left before the first show up, but do you... Maybe want to watch a movie while we wai-"

    r "I'm checking if this idiot over there has messed something up."

    pg "O- Oh, right, you have to do that."

    mc "Really? First thing the Dunning-Kruger bitch says to me is an insult, as usual."

    r "Do you expect anything else than the treatment of a twerp?"

    mc "Yeah, screw it, I'm going to my room while you have fun licking up dust to make sure it's clean."

    think "Hmph, at least he was competent enough to not screw something up."
    "I had just finished checking everything to make sure he wasn't stupid enough to leave a bowl of cereal or something around."
    "I made double sure everything was clean and having PG check on other stuff."
    "At least she has some interest in doing this right."

    "And just in time, the first guest arrived."
    "I already had a good guess as to who it was."

    "That couple was always way earlier than anyone else."

    "I was of course right. Maria and Eric always managed to be there early, due to Maria having the annoying tendency of wanting to snoop around before everyone shows up."

    r "Maria, Eric, welcome."

    maria "MC! You're here already as well!"

    maria "Heheh, did Rumi employ you as her new butler?"

    "She grinned to herself at her shitty joke, and of course Eric cracked a grin as well like the pathetic boyfriend he was."

    maria "Just kidding! It's good to see you."

    maria "Eric, show him what you brought."

    eric "Here."
    "He held up a rather large plastic bag which was filled with rattling bottles."

    eric "The strongest you can find around here."

    r "Is this what I think it is?"

    eric "If you're thinking shots, sure is."

    r "You sure you should be bringing that?"

    eric "It's for the guys. The girls would go crazy after drinking this stuff, so better we get wasted instead. Heh."

    maria "Can you believe it? Even I don't know where he managed to buy this stuff! I don't even think it's legal for us to have it!"

    maria "I tried that stuff and I'm lucky he didn't have the guts to completely manhandle me while I was completely wasted, haha."

    maria "Even if I wouldn't have minded..."

    r "...And you're bringing {i}that{/i} to my party?"

    maria "Are you collaborating with Rumi on parties now too? Haha, you guys have been hanging out so much that she's even rubbing off on you."

    r "I wish it were the other way around."

    r "Anyways, get inside already."

    maria "Sure thing. Oh, and you still aren't going to spill anything about your romance between each other?"

    r "For the last time, there is no romance!"

    maria "Mhm. If you say so."

    maria "Let's go get some chips, babe."

    eric "Heh, sure."

    think "For fucks sake, can she let this go already?"
    "She'd been pestering me all the time lately, about somehow being in a loving relationship with my own body."
    "And I mean, sure, \"MC\" was spending an unusual amount of time with \"Rumi\" recently, but of course she had to interpret it as a freaking romance."

    think "It just reminds me of why I hate people who gossip about me..."

    #transition with more people at the party

    "Eventually, most people started to arrive."
    "If I didn't know better, this was like any of my other parties."

    "Well, if it weren't for this guy."

    #scene party

    "As the evening began to really roll around, no major issues had really presented themselves."
    "Music was good, everyone was chatting, some already dancing..."
    "The outlook towards success was starting to become visible for once during these last three weeks."
    "I had also spent a lot of time tutoring Weeb in socializing with girls properly. He actually took it to heart, which was completely alien to me."
    "Because right now, he actually felt a bit more relaxed and not up in your face."
    "I frequently gave him a thumbs up when I he shot a glance my way. The girls not slapping him in the face was a constant success."
    "I was almost proud of how he was currently talking to Maria and that Audrey girl that MC apparently was in contact with without them having a look of disgust on their faces."

    think "It really was a good idea to bring him, huh?"
    think "Huh? A phone call?"
    think "Who is it now?"

    "As I took out the phone from my pocket, I saw the person contacting me and dreaded in silence."
    think "Annoying Citrus. Fuck."
    "This May girl had gotten a hold of my number and was calling me in the most annoying times possible. Right now was one of those times."

    think "Better tell her to screw off and not call me anymore today."

    m "-better pick up his stupid pho-"

    m "Oh! Hey MC!"

    r "I can't talk right now, so stop calling me today. Got it?"

    m "What do you mean?"

    m "Wait, who are these people behind you-"

    m "Are you throwing a party without inviting me, MC?!"
    r "See you, hopefully never."
    m "Hold up, answer me, MC!"

    think "Now to put it on silent mode."

    pg "Who was that?"

    r "Oh Jesus Chris-"

    r "Stop scaring me like that!"

    pg "...Sure..."

    pg "But who was that? MC's mom?"

    r "It was that annoying sister of Mike."
    r "Gosh, can she leave me freaking alone already?"

    r "Like, does she need to be hit by a car or something before she gets the hint that I don't give a damn about her?"

    r "It's as if I'm her only fucking friend, and I can't stand having to talk to a measly little shitty runt like her!"

    pg "Are you, like, okay?"
    r "Who? Me?"

    pg "Who else?"

    r "What the hell do you think? I'm doing just fine, for your information. Why are you even asking?"

    pg "No offense, but you've been acting really tense lately, and I don't think I've seen you talk to MC today at all."

    pg "So are you sure you're okay? You sound like you're bottling up a lot of frustration as of late."

    r "Of course I'm okay. Have you ever seen me not being okay?"
    r "Besides, as long as that dickhead doesn't screw up I'd rather not talk to him {i}at all{/i} anymore. Let alone right now."

    pg "{i}Sigh...{/i} You two really... Uh... Need to fix things, you know?"

    r "And why should I listen to that idiot talking for even a second?"
    pg "Do I really have to explain why? You're still living his life, you two should work together, not against each other."

    r "Oh, lay it off already! You're starting to sound more and more like you adore him more than me!"

    pg "...What? Who?"

    r "MC!"

    pg "...Ohhh..."

    think "Wait, don't tell me she's already..."

    r "How many have you had already?"

    pg "How many cans?"

    r "Yes, how many?"

    pg "Uh... I think this is my ninth...?"

    r "What?! The clock is not even eleven yet, and you've been downing cans of alcohol like it's a fucking bachelor's party!"
    r "You're supposed to help keep an eye out here!"

    pg "Ngh... Well, it's not my fault you know! If only that asshole would finally tell me that he likes me too, then I wouldn't try to-"

    r "Wait, who? Weeb?"

    pg "Well, duh..."

    pg "He isn't getting drunk at all! What's with him?"

    pg "It makes, like... No sense."

    r "You- Ugh..."

    r "You're a light-weight, you idiot. If you keep going you're going to be out soon."

    pg "Then make him tell me that I look good!"

    r "What the hell is your obsession with this guy?!"

    pg "He said I look ugly! I don't! Look at me!"

    pg "If I just... Keep drinking with him then maybe sometime later..."

    r "Oh my god..."

    r "Don't tell me you're trying to get him wasted in order to make him say he likes you..."

    pg "Uh..."

    pg "...No...?"

    r "Doesn't it defeat the fucking purpose if he tells you without being at his senses? Because he'd be wasted?"

    pg "When you're drunk, you spill the truth of what you're thinking."

    pg "I think."

    pg "Yeah!"

    r "Oh my god, you're a completely lost cause..."

    pg "No, I'll even record it so you believe me when I say it!"

    r "That wasn't what I was talking abou- Oh, fuck it."

    think "At least I now know that {i}she{/i} isn't going to be of any fucking help today."

    "Another half an hour passed."
    "It was perplexing not being the center of attention all the time, and mc seemingly wasn't screwing things over..."
    "Still, instead of talking with the people he was {i}supposed{/i} to be talking with, he kept spending time with Eric, Mike, PG..."
    "The same group of friends like fucking always."
    "I had a lot of time to think about things right now, and I had to slowly accept that things wouldn't go back to how they were before."
    "I was in a terrible mood. The benefits I had from being the leader of the highest circle of people in school was evaporating in front of my eyes."
    "It had been evaporating since this semester started. And fuck, it was frustrating not being able to do anything about it."
    "Again, I kept thinking to myself, \"Why MC? What's so special about him\"."
    "I mean, sure, his family is great and he has friends, but the same was true for me too, right?"
    "But really, what mistake did I do to be swapped with him..."

    mc "Whee~~"

    think "{i}Sigh...{/i} Add one more item to the list of issues that I have with this guy."

    mc "See? My equibribrium is totally fine even after spinning~~"

    "I knew that my body could take a lot of alcohol before getting really wasted, so either that doesn't matter due to this swap and this guy doesn't know how to handle being drunk or he really had way too much already."

    r "I am {b}not{/b} spending time with you. And stop drinking the punch! It's fucking filled with alcohol!"

    maria "They weren't there, at all!"

    maria "I checked all trying rooms the shop had, but none of the clothes he brought in were there!"

    weeb "A robbery?"

    weeb "Perhaps you would be interested in the new Moogle watches then."

    maria "Moogle what?"

    weeb "It is a watch that is currently being developed by Moogle. I believe it has an in-built camera that you can use on the fly."

    r "In all seriousness, the fucking nerve she has to tell me how \"{i}she's so sorry{/i}\" after making me go through middle-school for four years without anyone to talk to because they decided I wasn't good enough based on made-up rumors..."

    mc "...You really don't have any attachment to Kat or anything?"

    r "Ugh, but it's just {i}so annoying{/i} that not even my parents give a shit anymore."

    r "...But I do..."

    r "I just... Really want them to make me something good for dinner for once again..."

    r "Or maybe just, ask me if I'm okay, or watch a movie with me, or make me something for breakfast..."

    mc "Wai- Wait, repeat that last one again?"

    r "Huh? Oh, the girls in your pants?"

    r "...Obviously. You're friends with {i}her{/i}."

    mc "We could be kind of like a team together instead of just opponents, right?"

    r "God, you really suck at being cheesy."

    mc "Hey, I'm trying to motivate you!"
