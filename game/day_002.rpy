    r "Sure, you do your thing."

    "I finished my plate. I wasn't late yet, but I still had to make sure this guy didn't fuck up everything again."

    "I left the table, but Ms. Davis still kept me from going."

    mcmom "Sorry, but before you go, could you do the dishes today? I have to meet earlier than normally for a quick meeting, and if I have to do my usual routine I don't think I'll make it in time."

    think "Do they expect that I, like, actually do this?"

    think "I've never done this in my life..."

    "I decided to just do it. There is no way that I can't live as David Davis, I may be one of luxury and status, but that does not mean that I am unable to do these mundane things that he can."
    "Even then, I despised having to do this, but Ms. Davis would probably flip completely if I didn't do it."
