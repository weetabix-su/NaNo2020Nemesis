    "Lunch had basically become our regular meeting spot for the last few weeks, and today was supposed to be no exception."
    "For once, me and Angela were the first to get to the table we've managed to secure as our own now."
    "Without really talking much, we had sat down and started eating what we bought from the canteen."

    "And, uh..."
    think "It's been kind of awkward today."

    "The fight me and Rumi had was still lingering in the air."

    "I would have thought that Angela would have taken Rumi's side more and ridiculed me for pissing her majorly off, but she had been surprisingly okay with me throughout the entire day."

    "She didn't talk quite as much, but she was still walking around with me from classroom to classroom as usual."

    "She spun around and walked away."

    pg scared "Wha- Rumi, wait!"

    "She was distressed about her, quote unquote, \"best friend\" just not bothering to respond, but to my surprise, Angela didn't follow her."

    show pg think

    "Instead, she went and sat down again, although with a really sad expression on her face."

    pg "\"Uhm\" what?"

    mc "...Sorry if this rift between us affects you."

    pg scared "{i}Sigh...{/i}"

    pg "It's fine."

    think "Now that's a response I didn't expect to hear."

    pg think "She'll... Come around eventually. Sometimes she just gets really angry at something... Or someone."

    pg "What I'm worried about is tomorrow..."

    mc "Ah, yeah..."

    pg "And I'm not just simply worried about her being happy again, it's more about-"

    mc "{size=-5}Is she even able to be happy?{/size}"

    pg scared "Can you keep your quips to yourself for now, thanks?"

    mc "...Sorry."

    pg think"I'm worried about what might happen in the future between us..."

    pg "Rumi is one of my only friends and my best friend. If the two of you don't swap back soon, I might never talk to her again in the future."

    mc "...Oh, it's like that..."

    think "..."
    think "I really want to swap back myself, but everything we've tried so far doesn't even work..."

    "The past few days have in between school-hours been a constant adventure of Rick and Rumi coming up with weird schemes that could trigger some sort of swap similar from a manga or light novel."
    "But it's just been complete bollocks, all of it. Some were so outlandish that I even wondered why they thought it would work in the first place."

    mc "Hey, Rick, you haven't heard anything from Caren yet, right?"

    weeb "Hm? Ah, Caren? I'm afraid not."

    weeb happy "I do know that she is heavily interested in the topic. I am actually visiting her later this afternoon. Do you want me to tell her something?"

    mc "Oh, no, I was just curious if maybe she figured out something really quickly."

    weeb think "Ah, I am sorry to disappoint you then."

    mc "Well, to disappoint me I would have needed some sort of hope in the first place."

    weeb "...That sounds rather grim."
    mc "Yeah, kinda does."
