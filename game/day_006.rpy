    "If this wasn't basically the taste of defeat then I didn't know anymore."
    "Even then, texting the three people I talked to yesterday was still the ace in my pocket. I had just recently texted them that this was all a joke. No way they wouldn't see him like a scumbag now then!"

    weeb "Ah yes, about this highly fascinating light novel I read just recently-"

    "I had already texted all of them when we entered the lunchroom, so it was only a matter of time until rumors would spread about him, I bet."

    r "Of course not! I'm not lesbian you asshole."

    r "Fine, if you go, we're even with the glasses."

    mc "Seriously? That's your logic? In the first place, you started it because you dyed my hair!"

    r "In the first place I did it because {b}you{/b} decided to ditch cheerleading, and still do!"

    mc "Wait, that's why you did it?"

    r "You didn't fucking realize until now?!"

    mc "Hey- No, Rumi, I'm- I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that, it's just, you know..."

    r "Go to the fucking mixer with me."

    think "...Man, I didn't know that this was how she felt. She actually seems completely broken over her sudden change in sexuality..."
    think "Although I feel the same as well."
    "Being attracted to guys even though you know you aren't. It was a feeling that was indescribable."
    "Instincts clashing together, basically. I kind of felt confused, but that was about it, but for her it must be much more serious if she even started pleading to me to go to this thing in her own way."

    mc "{i}Sigh{/i}... Alright..."

    mc "You want to go to make sure we both feel this way, right? No tricks, no dating between us, right?"
    r "Of course."

    mc "Okay, but if I do this, we're even. I get to wear what I want as long as it isn't a clown outfit-"

    #street scene

    "Ah yes, sweet release. We were done with the half-day at school today and finally had weekend once more."

    "Tomorrow would be the day where I would go to this dreaded mixer with Rumi of all people, and it was stressful thinking about it, but sometimes I think it's important not to make her too angry."

    pg "See you on monday then."

    mc "Ah, uh... You don't want to come in for a drink or something since your parents arent home and everything?"

    "She looked at me as if confused about it. For whatever reason she didn't expect this at all."

    pg "No... It's okay, I don't... Uh, usually just enter her house, you know..."

    mc "Huh? You don't?"

    mc "Has Rumi never invited you over to just hang out?"

    pg "What? No, of course not! We hang out in the mall and I get to go to her home if we are setting things up for her parties. That's it."

    "Well that took a sad turn. I didn't expect them to have a friendship this terrible."
    "What she was saying was essentially that Rumi never let her just casually visit her, even though they walked to school and back every single day..."
    mc "No, please, if that's the case, I really insist. I'm not Rumi, remember? Or do you have anything better to do?"
    pg "Well, no, but..."
    mc "Come on! You get to just casually hang out in her house. Doesn't that sound exciting?"

    pg "If you put it like that, sure, but-"

    mc "Then make yourself comfortable. Come on, what's the harm?"

    pg "...Alright, you win, sure."

    "At least I could spend some idle time of the day on talking to PG right now. I actually liked talking to her on occasions now."

    mc "Uh... So let's see... We got apple juice, raspberry juice... Something called lemon water...?"
    pg "Lemon water sounds good."
    mc "Coming right up!"

    "I did have my console in my room now which helped entertain me, and I managed to break Rumi's phone lock too, so life was a bit more bearable, with not having anything to do the entire day and all."
    "But still, I did like talking to people, that much hasn't changed despite our swap."

    #scene Rumi's room

    pg "It's been so long since I've been in Rumi's room... It almost feels like I'm breaking some kind of law, heh."

    mc "You haven't been to her room? Aren't you guys close friends or something?"

    pg "Well, duh, but this is her {i}private{/i} room. The one she sleeps in and stuff."

    mc "Rumi has more rooms?!"

    pg "...Seriously, you didn't know?"

    mc "Why would she have multiple rooms? You mean bedrooms?"

    pg "I can show you later. Really, you live here and you don't even know that."

    mc "Don't blame me, I haven't had a guide yet."

    think "What would she even need more than one room for?"
    think "What am I thinking. It's Rumi. Logic doesn't apply like that."

    mc "But I'm looking forward to learning more about this place."

    pg "I only really know the living room area and where she hangs out when she wants to be in private."

    mc "Ah yeah, are you for real when you say she never invited you over?"

    pg "Why would she?"

    mc "But aren't you guys friends?"

    pg "Of course."

    mc "It just doesn't seem like the friendship goes both ways to me..."

    mc "You know, when I think of friends, I think of hanging out on a day off or doing stuff together."

    pg "What we do in our free time is none of your business, you know. Besides, we don't play the same friendship game like you guys do."

    pg "Rumi has qualities that you can't even understand, and before you came along she had status and power in her image alone."

    pg "We can't play some kid's game of {q}Hang out and cuddle with your friends{/q} like that."

    mc "But isn't that exactly what we're doing right now...?"

    pg "...No."

    pg "Well yes, but you aren't the real Rumi!"

    mc "Haha, you totally do enjoy sometimes just talking, don't you? Having talked to you for two weeks convinced me."

    pg "Sh- Shut up, I'm only doing this because it's you."

    mc "Heh, sorry."

    "It was really easy to figure out how she feels about certain things."
    "If I had never swapped with Rumi, I probably never would have seen pg in this kind of light, but she was really not that bad."
    "The only thing that stood out to me about her was the influence Rumi was having on her, and I personally didn't think it was the good kind of influence."
    "But whatever, right now I was in charge on that front."

    think "Actually, all this talk is making me remember about this thing I found some time ago."

    think "Maybe it's worth a shot asking PG about it."

    mc "Hey, by the way, I wanted to ask you something."

    pg "Hm?"

    mc "I found this thing after rummaging through the room."

    pg "Why have you been rummaging through Rumi's room? You know she would never allow that."

    mc "What she doesn't know, doesn't hurt her."
    "After digging through the drawers I found the thing I had been wondering about for a long time."

    #CG Picture (maybe?)

    mc "Here."
    pg "An old picture?"
    mc "Sounds like you don't know what it is either."
    pg "Hm, no, never seen it."
    mc "I just thought that this girl right here-"
    "I pointed at the little girl to the very left."
    mc "Doesn't she look a lot like Kat?"
    pg "..."
    mc "And this girl on the right looks like Rumi."
    "PG went silent the moment I mentioned Kat."

    #Exit CG

    pg "{i}Sigh...{/i}"
    pg "Look, I'm sure someone out there would appreciate your endless curiosity in the business of someone else..."
    pg "But this isn't something you're supposed to know about. I don't even know much about it and I'm next to Rumi constantly."

    mc "So you think I should stay out of trying to figure out the beef between Rumi and Kat?"
    pg "Exactly."

    mc "Ugh, fine. I'm just really curious as to why they hate each other so much..."
    mc "I know that they were friends at some point, but something {i}must{/i} have happened, especially if Rumi keeps this picture hidden."

    pg "You're really bad at letting a topic go just like that, huh?"

    mc "Seems like it."

    pg "That aside, why does Rumi have an ExBox in her room...?"

    mc "Oh, you know what it is? Do you have one yourself?"

    pg "Of course not. You think I'm some kind of nerd who knows about that stuff?"

    think "...But She still knows what an ExBox is..."

    mc "Alright, sorry, my bad."

    mc "But do you want to try playing?"

    "She eyed me and the console curiously. It was clear as day that she was conflicted and was really bad at hiding that."

    "The moment I had asked her the question I immediately realized that she totally did want to play, if just a little."

    pg "...No, but you can go ahead if you want to. I'll watch."

    mc "Wouldn't that be boring for you?"
    pg "I said it's fine, you only have one controller anyways."

    mc "Alright then."

    think "She even knows how controllers look."
    think "Heh, too easy to read."

    "I couldn't help but smirk."

    scene black

    pg "No, no, you're doing it all wrong, you need to first stack up blocks and wait for a straight block to appear."

    mc "Am I not doing that already?"

    pg "You need to wait until you have four height rows before you drop a straight block down there, else you lose the multiplier."

    pg "Geez, I thought you were good at games and even I know more about Dedris than you."

    mc "Hey, I've never really played Tedris before."

    pg "As if that's an excuse. If you're good at one game then another game gets easier to pick up."

    pg "So if you nerd through tens of games the next one should be ever easier to learn."

    think "...Why does she know so much about games..."

    "I only had the games that were installed on my console, so after we got bored of them we started playing some retro games that were already installed when I bought it."
    "And for some reason, pg of all people was tutoring me in how to play them at what is basically competitive level..."

    mc "So are retro games your thing?"

    pg "No games are my thing! And don't miss the middle with the L-block."

    mc "Right..."

    think "Geez, she'd rip my hair out if I missed an obvious placement for these blocks."
