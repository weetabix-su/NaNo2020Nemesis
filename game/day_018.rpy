    "So, this supposed party Rumi was throwing every month without me knowing about it was starting to creep up."

    "As a result, I ended up bringing Angela and Rumi along with me home."


    r "{size=-5}Angela, we need to check the lights in the kitchen.{/size}"

    pg "Coming!"
    "And now they were rushing around the house to check things."

    "You could consider it as a different kind of entertainment. Rumi had completely forgotten I existed, which made it possible for me to munch on popcorn in the living room while watching TV."
    "I was still feeling a bit melancholic after the talk I had with Kat yesterday, but I felt a bit better after me and Caren texted each other about what had been happening on both sides of our friend group."
    "It was one thing I had thought about a lot recently. I had become way too emotional after swapping with Rumi, which had to be another side-effect like the liking guys thing."
    "The confrontations with Kat made that obvious."

    r "{size=-5}The lights are working fine, right?{/size}"

    pg "{size=-5}Uhm... All good, all lights work.{/size}"
    think "But really, they're even checking if all of the 20 small light bulbs in the kitchen work...?"

    think "And yeah, I checked, there are exactly 20 light bulbs in the kitchen."
    think "Don't blame me, this place is {i}that{/i} boring."

    "But after all, the only response to the situation that came to mind was \"Ah well\" after I dropped another two or three popcorn down into my mouth."

    "The peace didn't last long though. Rumi wanted to check if every formal thing was in check."
    "I had busted my ass off doing what she told me, making sure her parents knew that she was throwing the party (and of course getting permission for it), and all other stuff like alcohol, snacks, you name it."

    "They stayed for a long time. Every little nook was checked, as if fanatic that everything would be perfect."
    "And to that end, I just had to ask."

    mc "Hey, is this really just a regular party?"

    show rumi think at one with dissolve

    r "What do you mean?"

    mc "I mean, you are really making a huge deal out of this. Will it really matter if you've made sure there isn't a single speck of dust behind the refrigerator?"

    show rumi laugh at one

    r "Really? You still haven't noticed?"
    mc "...Noticed what?"

    show rumi happy at one

    r "That this is my last chance of redeeming myself as a public figure?"

    mc "...Public figure?"

    show rumi think at one

    r "Oh my god, you are just so dense..."

    r "You've ruined me over these last three weeks. This is my last chance to make sure I'm not perceived as some sort of boring librarian the way you're making me look right now."

    r "Unlike you, I actually believe we can swap back. I bet you're having the time of your life as me, so you don't worry too much about the bigger picture as always, but some of us want to right what's wrong."

    show rumi scared at one

    mc "Wait, hold up. Don't start thinking I don't want to swap back either here, I've already made it perfectly clear several times that your life sucks."

    show rumi think at one

    r "Well if it sucks so much then why are you spending your useless brain power on video games if you've managed to hack your way into my computer and phone, huh?"

    mc "Those are {i}essentials{/i} in our current day and age! If I didn't forcibly break open the locks to your devices then I'd have to buy new ones entirely!"

    r "That's not the point! You are breaching my privacy by having access to my files!"

    mc "Oh my god, can you please, for the love of god, shut up about our privacy?!"

    mc "In case you haven't noticed, right now, that computer and that phone are both {i}my{/i} property, and I-"

    r "Don't you dare say another word about property, as if you know who it belongs to!"

    mc "You sure as hell believed that my life was your property when you tried to kill my relationship with Kat!"

    r "That bitch had it coming!"

    mc "Fuck no she didn't! She's been going through hell and you only made it worse! I can only say that it's pure luck she's even wanted to talk to me recently!"

    show rumi scared at one

    r "What?! You're talking with Katrina?!"

    mc "As if it concerns a self-centered douchebag like you who I talk to-"

    show rumi think at one

    r "You piece of fucking shit! I knew it, the moment I started to trust you just a little bit, you begin backstabbing me just like her!"

    mc "You call this a display of trust? Don't make me laugh, you'e been commanding me around like I'm your stupid puppy or something!"

    pg "If you don't stop it right now, then I'm calling both of your parents until we figure something out!"

    mc "What, is that supposed to be some kind of threat?"

    show pg think at two_left

    pg "You should know by now how Rumi's parents work, shouldn't you?!"

    "...Crap, she did have a point. I already didn't live up to their ideals of their perfect daughter who wouldn't embarrass them or their image, so I sure as hell wouldn't want to endure whatever punishment they could come up with..."

    pg "Did you two idiots finally come to your fucking senses then?"

    show rumi scared at two_right

    r "Angela, don't you dare call me an id-"

    pg "You clearly aren't in the right mindset to make any decisions right now, so I'm taking the fucking wheel here!"

    pg "You're both left alone for even a few minutes and it ends up with both of you shouting your lungs out just because you can't agree on the most minor things!"

    pg "If you're going to continue like this, then there {i}is{/i} no saving your image, Rumi! We need this jerk if we want there to be any point to this party!"

    "She turned her head away after a long scoff."

    "This absolute bitch was criticizing my every life choice, and I was getting sick of it."
    "This stupid party would be the very last thing I would even attempt to tolerate, and only because we had already sent out the invitations for it."
    "Cutting ties with this child should have been the solution from the beginning. At least then I wouldn't have to put up with her constant crying and could peacefully hope we might swap back one day."
    "Nothing we tried was working anyways, and no fucking wonder. After all, we barely interacted in the first place, so us performing some sort of ritual that allowed a full body swap by accident was practically impossible."

    "The day ended up with a very hostile feeling in the air."
    "I intentionally avoided talking to her, and she did the same."
    "We were both clearly at our limits of tolerance it seemed, and my pride only allowed for one goodbye to Angela."
    think "As if I'd ever talk to her again."
    "That was the only thought in my head."
    "I now cemented it into my brain. I hated her with a burning passion. I wanted out of this sickening scenario I was put into."
    "I just couldn't wait to get this party over with and get back to regular school-days, and to hopefully talk with Rick, Caren and Kat on a nice noon where the only real concern was coming up with new non-sense to talk about after a long class with any of our teachers."
    "I hoped that once the new week started, everything could go back to the way it was before. That Caren somehow figured out how to swap two people."
    "And at the end of the day, that hope was the only thing that really kept me going right now."
    "I didn't want to live my remaining life as Rumi Sato."
    "I knew it in my very being that I did not want to."
