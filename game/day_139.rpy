    "Was I really being too demanding?"
    "I've been Rumi for almost half a year now, so naturally I would want to get along with the people that mattered in her family more."
    "Christmas is a tradition that was celebrated in my real home every year with people being happy, open and all of that..."

    "They promised that we would spend christmas together, those stupid parents!"

    "But instead, I got two texts telling me how \"We have {i}soooo{/i} much important stuff to do right now\", as if this {b}one{/b} favor from their own daughter was just some side-thing to worry about!"

    "Even if they were late, they told me they would be home by nine at the latest, but they still aren't here!"
    "I had even prepared dinner for them, all on my own without getting any help from them at all, having to look up recipes online and all of that."
    "But now even the food I had made was starting to get cold to the point where it wasn't edible any longer."

    "They weren't my real parents, but I still cared enough to at least not spend christmas of all things alone!"

    "And with perfect timing at the end of my angry monologue, I could finally hear the door from outside making a resemblance of sound."

    "I looked at the time, and it was twenty past ten at this point."

    "Oh, how I would scold them for taking so freaking long!"

    rdad "Hello sweetie. I\'m sorry I\'m home late."

    "..."

    "That's all he had to say?"

    "I waited a bit longer for more of an explanation, but nothing."

    "He just hung up his bullteaet and approached me."

    rdad "Here, I hope you like it."

    "He handed me a small box. Not even wrapped or anything."
    "He may run a business, but where the hell did he learn to suck so badly at reading the room?"

    mc "A christmas gift?"

    rdad "Yes."
    mc "Aren't those supposed to be wrapped up? Or put under a tree or something?"

    rdad "...Why would you want it wrapped? What difference does an additional coating of paper do?"

    mc "It's christmas! That's how you do it!"

    rdad "{i}Sigh...{/i} I am not in the mood for one of your breakdowns now, Rumi."

    mc "One of my breakdow- {nw}"

    mc "What?!"

    "He rubbed his temple to display that he was tired of me."

    "While ignoring my question, he walked into the living room in a completely calm fashion."

    "I had to spend a few seconds to process what just happened."
    "Did he seriously just break his promise, then call me unstable when I get angry at him?!"
    "Even ignoring the food I had spent all day making just for them?!"

    "He breaks his {i}{b}one promise{/b}{/i}, and is annoyed at {i}me{/i}?!"

    "To make matters worse, I could now hear the TV going."
    "He straight up ignored his daughter to go and watch television on christmas evening!"
    think "That's it! I've fucking had it!"

    mc "Seriously? That's everything you got from what I just said?!"

    rdad "...Really, what is going on with you right now?"
    rdad "You haven't had anything to drink, have you?"

    mc "{size=+5}Ugh! You- You terrible-!{/size}"

    "My head was boiling at this point. I didn't care what was in the box he gave me."

    "I threw it on the ground as hard as I could together with my christmas hat."

    "He was shocked that I would do it, and immediately transitioned into a very serious expression."

    rdad "What do you think you're doing?! Do you think I gave that to you as a joke?!"

    "I couldn't stand it anymore. It was like mental abuse."
    "I knew he would get angry as all hell at me for saying \"{i}Fuck you{/i}\" to him. And I didn't want to listen to him anymore."
    "Not today."
    "It was chilly outside. Very chilly. And I only had the dress and bullteaet on."
    "But it still felt better than having to be next to him. It only cemented how much I hated him. And Rumi's mom would probably not react very differently."

    "Even though I felt like crying right now, I was just too angry to do so."
    "But..."

    "Kat, Caren, Rick, Angela and Mike were still the only ones who really knew about it. But recently, it started becoming extremely lonely, despite those five knowing my actual identity."
    "So I took the courage to perhaps do this today. To perhaps convince my mom of who I really was."

    "Me and Rumi both agreed that we would tell my mom about the situation the day after, and we did."
    "She had noticed that something was off long ago, and hesitated a bit when we told her."

    "It turned out to be a good christmas night after all, and I never looked back on those excuses of parents that were now my biological one."
